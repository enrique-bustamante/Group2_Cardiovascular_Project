# Cardiovascular Disease Project

## Overview
Heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women, and people of most racial and ethnic groups in the US. About 665,000 individuals die from heart disease each year in the US - 1 in every 4 deaths. It is also the most preventable.  Our group is reviewing a dataset that looks at patient data (age, weight, gender, smoking, activity level, etc) and the prevalence of cardiovascular disease. We're going to analyze which factors might contribute more heavily to the disease and shed light on a condition that can be preventable by taking a proactive approach to our lifestyle.

How can we improve our daily activities to prevent Cardiovascular disease? In this dataset we're given medical records with key health factors including if someone had a cardiovascular event.

Using medically examined data we aim to answer the following questions:
- What group of factors have the largest impact on a Cardiovascular event?
- From the 5-7 factors, can we narrow it down with PCA?
- Can we create a model that would predict a Cardiovascular event?

## Resources
The cardiovascular disease dataset is an open-source [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset) that is found on Kaggle.

## Database

## Dataset

The dataset contains 70,000 records (34,979 who have cardiovascular disease and 35,021 who do not have cardiovascular disease) and contains 11 features (consisting of 4 demographic, 4 examination and 3 social history).

- Age (demographic)
- Height (demographic)
- Weight (demographic)
- Gender (demographic)
- Systolic blood pressure (examination)
- Diastolic blood pressure (examination)
- Cholesterol (examination)
- Glucose (examination)
- Smoking (social history)
- Alcohol intake (social history)
- Physical activity (social history)

The 11 features above determine

## Communication Protocols

This set of rules will help unify our code and prevent issues.
* Before working on your portion it is best to pull in from the remote repository. To do so use "git pull origin main".
* When your push your commits, please either create a pull request and leave a message in the Group2 slack channel so that the git handler can merge the push with the main.
* When committing, please leave a comment to says what was either added or changed on the code and to which file. This will help when merging.
* When naming your variables, it would be preferable to use camel case (e.g. fileDatabaseCleaned) and have the name be more specific to the action taken and to the data it is taken on.
* ABC: Always be committing
* Please add comments on your scripts, particularly your pseudocode. While good code shouldn't need that many comments, it should include comments to guide the reader.
* As git handler, I will keep an eye on how many commits a group member's branch is behind the main. If it is a large amount, I'll reach out to the owner of the branch to pull and update from the main branch.
* When creating a new branch, use the following format: <Username> Segment <Segment number>
