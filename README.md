# Cardiovascular Disease Project

## Overview
Heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women, and people of most racial and ethnic groups in the US. About 665,000 individuals die from heart disease each year in the US - 1 in every 4 deaths. It is also the most preventable.  Our group is reviewing a dataset that looks at patient data (age, weight, gender, smoking, activity level, etc) and the prevalence of cardiovascular disease. We're going to analyze which factors might contribute more heavily to the disease and shed light on a condition that can be preventable by taking a proactive approach to our lifestyle.

How can we improve our daily activities to prevent Cardiovascular disease? In this dataset we're given medical records with key health factors including if someone had a cardiovascular event.

Using medically examined data we aim to answer the following questions:
- What group of factors have the largest impact on a Cardiovascular event?
- From the 5-7 factors, can we narrow it down with PCA?
- Can we create a model that would predict a Cardiovascular event?

## Resources
The cardiovascular disease dataset is an open-source [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset) that is found on Kaggle. 

## Dataset

The dataset contains 70,000 records (34,979 who have cardiovascular disease and 35,021 who do not have cardiovascular disease) and contains 11 features (consisting of 4 demographic, 4 examination and 3 social history).
