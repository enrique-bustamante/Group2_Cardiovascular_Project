# Cardiovascular Disease Project

## Overview
How can we improve our daily activities to prevent Cardiovascular disease? In this dataset we're given medical records with key health factors including if someone had a cardiovascular event.

Using medically examined data we aim to answer the following questions:
- What group of factors have the largest impact on a Cardiovascular event?
- From the 5-7 factors, can we narrow it down with PCA?
- Can we create a model that would predict a Cardiovascular event?
