# Group2_Cardiovascular_Project


## Communication Protocols

This set of rules will help unify our code and prevent issues.
* Before working on your portion it is best to pull in from the remote repository. To do so use "git pull origin main".
* When your push your commits, please either create a pull request or leave a message in the Group2 slack channel so that the git handler can merge the push with the main.
* When committing, please leave a comment to says what was either added or changed on the code and to which file. This will help when merging.
* When naming your variables, it would be preferable to use camel case (e.g. fileDatabaseCleaned) and have the name be more specific to the action taken and to the data it is taken on.
* ABC: Always be committing
* Please add comments on your scripts, particularly your pseudocode. While good code shouldn't need that many comments, it should include comments to guide the reader.
* As git handler, I will keep an eye on how many commits a group member's branch is behind the main. If it is a large amount, I'll reach out to the owner of the branch to pull and update from the main branch.
